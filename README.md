# kivy---what-i-did
This page is about what i learned about in kivy.

To continue with the kivy app development go to www.kivy.org
<br>
Lets dig a bit deeper on what KIVY is about.
     <li> 1. Kivy is GUI development framewook. </li>
     <li> 2. It supports Cross-Platform support. </li>
     <li> 3. Based on OpenGL (Open Graphics Library) wrapper for python. </li>
     <li> 4. Builtin modules and functions for easy use. </li>
     <li> 5. Support variety of option to play with GUI development. </li>

  In the step0_1 I imported the kivy using import. Later I called the App().run()<br>The whole program gonna use class syntax. Object Oriented concepts are required a lot here.<br>

<br>
  In the step0_2 I Createds a class called MyApp. It inherits the App class in kivy. Later on tutorials the inherited class can be styles using the kv language. There lies a function inside the MyApp class which should be named build. Why we name it as build? We will see it in later tutorials.<br>
